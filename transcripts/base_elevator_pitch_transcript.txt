Hello, my name is Andrea Fitzgera.
I am studying marketing at the University of Texas at Dallas.
I am a member of the American Marketing Association and Alpha Cafe SIE, both of which are dedicated to shaping future business leaders.
I hope to incorporate my business knowledge into consumer trend analysis and strengthening relationships among consumers, as well as other companies.
I am SAVI, social and principled, and have exquisite interpersonal communication skills.
I know that I can be an asset in any company and or situation, and I hope that you will consider me for an internship or job opportunity.
Thank you so much.
