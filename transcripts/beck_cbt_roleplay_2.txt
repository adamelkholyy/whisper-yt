Thank you.
I am
good to see you again.
look at your scores.
So I'm looking at these just got
Tell me in your own words.
been feeling this week.
better.
I don't know if I know exactly why, but I
film.
a little bit better than when I woke up.
in the morning I was able to
get up more more easily.
just like reading the paper.
even the sports section.
Like I was able to concentrate on little
Oh, that's wonderful.
I'm really glad to hear that.
It looks like you're...
Sleeping better too? Well, I...
I think that what I meant by that
was mostly that.
I didn't oversleep. Okay. Because
I had been spending a lot of time in
in bed and I didn't get up.
I would say I got up at 7.
and we only get up at 7.
Oh, that's great. That's great. And you're
looks like your concentration.
things like we've been in the newspaper.
that's a little better to.
Yeah.
Yeah, oh I'm really glad. So, um...
You said you don't have any ideas.
why you're feeling better.
because of the things that.
that we're doing here that are
helping.
get to those things in just a minute.
But let's set the agenda. So what we're
be your goal for.
today's session. Well...
I guess to
to start thinking about
difficult for me.
to do things to get better like we're
talk about doing.
going out and doing things.
and
And last time we talked about what
like things to be.
like by labor day.
So what's something that you would
would like to be able to do
but you've been having trouble doing.
with something
either going out or in the apartment.
Well, it's kind of like...
The evenings are really hard for me.
because
even if I go out and do something that
at the end of the day I go back and I'm
there by myself.
and then I'm just sort of
there with my thoughts. Yeah, good. Okay. So
We'll try to get to evenings anything
the next day.
Any other goals you have?
I would say that that's probably the
the main thing well.
I should do something about.
my apartment. I don't keep after that.
Like I should.
And so maybe...
when you get your apartment in better
order? Yeah.
But that seems like such a big job.
I don't know where to start.
Yeah, well, maybe we could figure out
together where to start.
That sounds good.
So we're setting the agenda.
like to talk a little bit more about
these depressing thoughts that you
been having.
and talking some more about credit.
That's okay.
you
All right, you know what I'd like to do.
next is just to turn to the notes.
from actually from the evaluation.
and then the notes from
last session.
I'll just read this and I'd like you to.
tell me what you think about this now.
When I start to feel more depressed,
You find it. Remind myself that
that the therapy plan makes sense.
Does it still make sense to you? Yes.
good night.
with Judith's help I'll be working
in Torrid Goals every week step by step.
I'll learn how to evaluate my thinking.
which might be 100% true
0% true or someplace in
the middle.
What do you think about that?
I think this.
the idea of working toward goals.
every week is
is a good idea.
I think that you're helping me to figure
what those things are.
is good. If I evaluate my thinking
which may be a hundred percent.
or not, or somewhere in the middle.
You know, we really haven't done that yet.
help you evaluate your thinking.
you've just been identifying you're thinking.
doesn't make sense to you that you might
still be seeing the world through Black
glasses.
mostly. Yeah, that's my not
all the thoughts are 100%.
They most alike.
My thoughts are, but when I go out into
do things that I feel better when I'm
doing that.
I don't have as many black dots.
Yeah.
So it sounds like this next part is true.
then the way I feel better is by
making small changes in my thinking.
and behavior every day. Excellent.
And we also talked about
at the evaluation.
cover it just a little bit last.
sessions. So I want to talk a bit.
about it more this session. Give myself
credit.
for doing things on the action plan.
for doing anything else that helps me get
over the depression.
and for anything that's even a little
bit difficult but I do it anyway.
We're getting any better at giving yourself
credit this week.
I think so. I mean last week I hadn't
really done that much that I really felt
that I deserve to be.
credit. But I try to push myself this
we can do the things we talked about.
so I can't.
Yeah, I was better because I was able
to.
recognize I was pushing myself and doing
I think in a few minutes
We will talk about it.
keeping credit less to some will get.
to that too.
you
So again, what was the best part of
this past week or when did you feel
the best one where you at your best.
up for a walk is better than
sitting on the couch, but you know, I...
when I went out with my grandson.
again and that was good. Ethan again.
He's done.
Yeah, what you do with them?
Well, we just went out and got ice cream.
again.
different flavors.
Did you like your tribe?
It was a chocolate swirl thing.
Which is different?
better.
vanilla the week before.
the same.
I like trying something new.
It's good, it for you.
So you're at your best when you took
Ethan for ice cream again.
Yeah. And again, what was good about
without taking them for ice cream.
I think it's just fun to be
with him and
just talk about stuff and feel
kind of like a normal person.
Yeah. So you felt less depressed?
when you're out with him.
Yeah, that's good. So does that imply?
actually you might be able to do
things that can help you feel better.
him or was it still hard?
It was easier than the first time.
and lot easier than the first target.
I mean, I still have some questions.
but it was a lot easier.
You know, if it was easier, it next me.
think that you're thinking must have been
different.
Do you know what you were thinking?
and she with. So you're getting ready to go.
out with him.
What we think I was thinking.
Well last time went pretty
good. So,
be good too.
So I was just sort of...
as I was going to do it.
you are making a positive prediction.
And you moved with better? Yeah.
it made it easier to go out.
That's great. Okay. I wanted to just give
back to
the therapy notes from
last week too.
I did. Yeah. I read it.
We have to pull them out any other time.
the day I'm not sure we even.
I just sort of
like after I got up in the morning and
took a shower and stuff like this.
you would read this.
Right, right. Okay, so tell me what you're
think of this.
When I criticize myself remember, I'm
I'm only looking at part of the scene.
and it's through black glasses. Judy says
This is not my fault.
It's happening because I have depression.
I think that there's some truth to that.
Do you think you're accepting this fact?
more that you do have a real illness.
Last week, I think it was a hard thing to do.
even think about. What do you mean?
That was the first time that I'd really
thought about it in that way.
when you went.
down and read them list of things to me.
I mean, I could say, yeah, that's...
That's me. That's you. So I think that.
It's in a bull, okay?
me something yeah
So are you thinking now that you're
Your condition is more like pneumonia.
something that happens that has these
really negative symptoms makes
everything harder.
Good. That's good.
you
And then we talked about last week about
how you're thinking
influences how you feel and what you do.
We are breath.
Catch any of those automatic thoughts.
this week. I don't think I even caught
automatic.
you're just your depressed thoughts.
God, yeah.
Did you catch any of this cake?
Yeah, when I
that sitting on the couch was
is hard so when I was sitting there
There would be times when I...
I just think that.
I'm not going to get better.
And when you had that thought, how did
that make you feel.
bad.
it all, they're just because you think
something doesn't necessarily mean it's
I'm sure you'll like it.
Yeah, I did.
and I can't say I believe that 100%.
but I believe it more.
beginning.
Thanks, babe.
and then probably in my weaker moments.
I said, you know, this isn't going to be
work.
Meaning this therapy?
So I went out.
had ice cream with my grandson.
I ought to be doing that anyway.
I went for a walk, I'd be doing
So that really self-critical.
Yeah. All right, can we talk um
Yeah, I think I'll come back to the right
the homework in a few minutes.
Let's talk about a credit list of that.
Sorry.
you
It seems to me that you've lost a lot of
confidence in yourself.
Yeah. It seems to me, Velasco.
confidence in a lot of ways.
So, you've lost confidence about your
ability to work.
You're afraid that even if you got a job
He wanted to do it very well.
seems like you've lost confidence in
and your ability to keep your apartment in
water.
loss confidence in.
it harder to get together with friends.
You think I'm right about this? No.
and we are.
even talk much about my ex-wife.
you know.
about the fact that the marriage
failed.
That's pretty good.
Not surprising that you've lost
confidence in yourself.
because that's what depression really
does. It really makes you lose confidence.
and it's really, really important.
for you to recognize.
that you are taking steps to take
control of your life again.
credit list.
in writing if you can. In fact,
See I think did I bring this with
No, I didn't.
So you could just keep it on any kind of
piece of paper.
or you could keep this credit list on a.
three by five car that you keep in your
pocket.
or you could keep a list on your phone.
and this is just like my saying good job.
to myself.
Exactly. Exactly. And this is when I want
you to do what we talk a little bit.
about this at the evaluation.
whenever you do anything that's even a
little bit difficult.
but you do it anyway. You deserve credit.
for that.
Okay.
plan for you.
Now, if you had pneumonia,
And yet, you were able to get yourself
out of bed, able to go to the
supermarket.
you were able to put in a load of
laundry.
would you think you deserve credit for
point.
even though I think I'm supposed to do
them, I haven't done them for a long time.
Exactly. That's exactly right.
depression has been
So severe, it's been so hard for you to do.
do these things.
And it sounds to me as if you've done
some things this week that were even
little bit difficult but it did the
anyway.
Is that right? Yeah, going for the walks
and
and I walk by the church one day too.
Oh, that's great.
Alright, so we can start your credit
list right now.
Should I give you a piece of paper?
to your.
So you said this week you walk by
church.
ice cream was it easy?
a little bit difficult.
Then it goes on the list.
Ethan out for ice cream.
What did you even do today?
little bit difficult, but you did it.
anyway.
even on the list, but when I
when I after I got up and took my
shower this morning.
I straightened up a couple things.
the
even a little bit difficult.
It was really hard.
I guess.
I didn't make a big dent in everything.
that needs to be done.
And that's we have that on our agenda.
talk more about today.
But you did some things around the
We had an even talk.
about your doing there.
and then just move them around a little bit.
Okay.
Clear path to walk through.
and have been better if you hadn't done it.
It's good idea. It's all day.
absolutely belongs on the list.
How about getting on a bed with that?
easy today.
There's a lot of these here. Well,
I'm so I wake up and
lots of times I just stay in bed.
what I've been.
trying to do is push myself to actually
get out of bed when I wake up at 7.
So I pushed myself and ended up.
All right, so can you write down?
of that.
you
You know, a lot of people say, well, why don't you
I deserve credit for getting out of bed.
it's just what I should do.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. Okay, so I have to tell you.
that every morning when I get out of bed.
I give myself credit.
because I would much rather, you know.
Turn off the alarm, go back to sleep.
But I doubt.
the
And I'm not even depressed.
So, Abe, once you're over the depression,
and I'll be your choice as to whether you
give yourself credit for getting out of
bad or not.
But while it's still even a little bit
difficult. It's really important. Okay.
Can you see how giving yourself credit?
for these things.
might help you build up your confidence.
show you that you are able to do things.
that are difficult.
I wasn't thinking about it that way, but actually
I mean, I just...
kind of feel better at thinking about it.
Yeah. That I'm doing those things.
I have to somehow remind myself that
has to do with building confidence.
That's good. Should I write that on
you're actually
plan to. Yeah. So when I do anything
that's even a little bit difficult.
myself.
credit and how should I phrase it?
This will build my confidence.
This will build my confidence.
was even a little bit difficult.
I thought about doing something.
but I didn't do it.
How about coming to therapy today?
even a little bit difficult.
Yeah. Okay. That goes on your list.
too, so came to the R&D.
So we have a bunch of things that you
did just even today.
that you deserve credit for.
Now, if you don't give yourself credit
for those things, what happens?
I think about it the same way.
always did that I
ought to be doing that stuff anyway.
And so you feel like guilty, you feel bad.
Feel very guilty, lazy. Right.
instead of wow. These things are hard.
because I'm depressed.
So of course you deserve credit for
doing.
Do you think you could keep
So, this like this every day.
Maybe it would help if I
I will do this while I'm sitting on the
couch at night time.
That's all I
I have trouble.
Yeah, okay, so keep list.
do it night. Now the only problem with
only doing it at night is that
You're like most people you're likely to forget.
90%.
what you actually did.
I'm wondering what
I see you wearing the rubber band.
Thank you.
I sound like did that work to have you
ask yourself what was going through your
mind.
Yeah, when I had when when I was sitting
That's how...
I realize that that the evenings were
difficult because
I was kind of, I was sitting there and
having a hard time and normally
I just go get a beer and
not think about it.
But because it's theirs then I thought about
I
Then I knew what the thoughts were.
So I wonder if you could use the rubber band.
to remind you
not only to look for your depressing
thoughts which might or might not be
you too.
but to also ask yourself what have I done?
done in the last
to our two hours or something like that.
that I deserve credit for.
use them the rubber band as a reminder.
you
you
Okay, so back to what you've got done this
past week.
We're able to take a look at
the goal list.
Yeah. Thank you. Do you have any changes?
on that.
No, I still, I mean visiting family is
still
really important.
Still the idea about the job.
like
I really want my look at it.
I really want one, but I'm afraid I'll miss.
it up still.
Yeah. So if we have time, maybe we'll get
back to that.
And the goal, this was one of the things.
I thought about what I didn't do.
thought about.
You know, calling, calling up one of my
for
Well, I think we had to, we had agreed
that might be too hard for you.
So I don't think that was even possible.
of your action plan.
Let me just see what was walking by the
church you said you did that.
Did you visit the kids other than
taking Ethan's right wing.
the other kids were there.
you know, spend a few minutes playing
with them. That's great.
you were going to go out to
supermarket. We're able to do that.
I'm dead. You know, I got...
vegetables and stuff in the house.
instead of just eating everything out of
of a can.
and you were supposed to try to get out
the house at least four times this
week. We're able to do it.
I mean, if I get the cow going
out with Ethan as one of those cars.
then.
Is it even more than four?
that. I walk by the church one day.
I did maybe five days. Oh, excellent.
So what would you like to do this week?
in terms of getting out of the house.
Maybe we're right now.
four to six times? How does that sound?
I should pay a shit.
in your action plan.
able to do that.
Now, of house 46 times.
So you were able to get out of the house.
What was good about getting out of that?
I was
What did it show you?
things that up to this point.
thought I couldn't do. Right.
I thought I couldn't do.
Yeah, when I do them.
I feel good about them. So, this is...
You can apply that maybe you can start to take
more control over your mood.
in the face.
question in my head does this mean that
So it's kind of like a...
How about a maybe this means?
So that's right. Maybe.
This means what?
that I can take control.
Yep, exactly. There are things I can do.
to take control.
about depressing thoughts.
And then maybe we can talk about getting
your apartment in order or would you
We'd rather talk about
evening. So if we only have time to get
to one of those, which would you like to get
you
Evenings. Evenings okay.
problem.
Yeah, okay, we'll do that. So you were able
to catch some of these depressing.
starts this week.
Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so.
What do you think of this idea that the
way that you feel.
say, for example, as you're taking a walk.
or add your with Ethan.
the way that you feel is going to depend
at least in great part as to what's
going through your mind.
that.
Yeah. And for example, so when you thought
I'll never get better.
did that have on your mood.
It's just making the press maybe more
give up exactly.
And if you have that thought again,
will never get better.
How would you like to answer that?
That's it.
I guess the first thing is it's...
That's not a sure thing that I'll never
get better and
and more excellent.
sure thing.
not be true.
because when I do stuff, I feel better.
Exactly, so you've really started to
and we'll prove that to you.
to yourself then. So I've started to
proof this.
to myself. And what was the other thought?
This isn't worth it.
Yeah.
therapy is going to work.
What would you like to remind yourself about?
that.
It seems like a little bit, it already is.
So it seems a little bit that it already
is.
That's good. All right, I got that on your
action plan for you.
Okay. Now.
We call these kinds of thoughts.
It just seemed to pop up and
to your mind. We call them automatic.
thoughts.
and it's not your fault that you're
having them.
The reason that you're having these
really negative automatic thoughts is
because you're depressed.
talking about that.
Okay. And so...
this week. You're going to use the rubber
to try to keep on identifying.
those thoughts.
and to keep on reminding yourself.
that.
and that's selling me that, it's true.
And here I've written down
answers to a couple of the automated
thought she had this past week.
might have this coming wake.
Okay. If I think I'll never get back
I
have started to prove this to
myself. This isn't going to work. If I
I think that remind myself it seems
a little bit that it already is.
Now before we get to evenings, we're
Maybe it has something to do with evenings.
the family is really important to you.
I wonder if there's something in the
You could do in the evenings.
You know, either being with your family.
or talking to them on the phone.
What would you like to be
able to do if you weren't depressed.
what we should do.
but I don't.
I don't want to invite myself, but
I could call them and talk to them.
phone.
you
and oftentimes when I call they invite
be over.
Okay, so you're gonna talk on the
found children.
My son and my daughter. Great.
I could give them a call.
gets in the way of you're saying
Hey, it was a convenient for me to come over.
I don't want my imposed.
So the thought is, if I invite myself,
I'll be imposing on them. Is that right?
I'll be
and posing on them.
figure out whether that thought is
100% true or zero percent.
or someplace in the middle.
I don't know it might be 100% true.
What makes you think that they'll see a
as an imposition.
Thank you. I just think of myself that.
What have you
before you got depressed, did you ever...
and invite yourself over. Yeah, God.
come over and spend some time with me.
the kids.
And did they seem to have negative
attitude about your doing that.
No, not at all. They always seemed happy.
I'm
whether any times when
you invited yourself over
where they said G today isn't a really
good time.
The Nazis, well, they... Yeah, they...
We just
instead of saying it's not a good time.
and they say something like
tomorrow would be better.
because we've got.
something scheduled.
right. So
If I could summarize what you just said.
in the past when you've
invited yourself over. They've been
and glad to see you.
and it sounds like they've been honest.
if it would be an imposition on them.
So have they changed in some way?
you think that they wouldn't want you
to come over now.
No, I think it's just I changed my
thinking the way it
think about what I get and do that.
spiral. Yeah, I start thinking that.
stuff and then
Guess it's stuff I just make up so if
Bye.
I wonder if another way of looking at it.
this is that
Maybe they would do exactly what they
done in the past, which is either
welcome you.
or to reschedule. I think that's possible.
Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I know.
If the worst happens and they say,
Sorry, but we're really busy now.
then how can you cope with that?
great idea, right?
So, but that's only the worst that could happen.
What's the best that could happen?
if you call one of them.
sure we'd love to have you over.
And would you like to come?
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
I think is the most realistic outcome.
They probably say something like...
Yeah, that'd be great. We'd be happy.
and I would like to add you over.
Thursday night would be a good
time.
Can you come over then?
realistic is that they'd be really glad.
that you called.
and they'd set on date with you.
They were always
Good in the past about those kinds of
things it's just white.
Just since I started.
going down hills more like
Me not calling them, not them.
saying they didn't want to see me.
So
How do you want to answer this thought?
If I invite myself I'll be imposing.
them.
happy to hear from me.
here for me. It's good.
So would you like to say yourself and
Action Plan item about this.
those.
What do you think, one or both?
optional. That sounds good.
Okay, so you can call your son or
which one's going to be optional?
my daughter will be optional.
for you to call them.
and try to go over one evening.
since evenings are so tough for you.
Yeah, yeah, that would be really good.
I could do that.
and then optionally you'd call the other
one and see if you can go over one.
anything.
do in the evenings.
Well, you know, the grandkids.
Thank you.
different kinds of activities going on.
Good.
I could go to something.
I could go to a game or...
a concert, you know, until...
you know this is sort of the end of the
school year for a doubt.
and they've got different kinds of
Things going on at school that I can't.
sounds great.
That's great. And on the evenings when
you.
stay in your apartment.
like to be doing.
I should do something.
Well, even if I can read the paper and
concentrate on it, that would be.
and improvement.
you might read the news paper.
read the entire sport section.
That would be an improvement.
Thank you.
politics, but that's getting harder.
I don't know if I want to do that.
now.
I think we should make the entire sports
session.
sports section optional.
but at least you'd be part of it.
Is that all right?
Yeah. And you mentioned, uh...
getting your apartment in better order.
Is there something you'd like to do
during the day.
the evening about that.
I should probably clean up the kitchen.
You know, I just...
to get the dirty stuff out of the sink.
put it away.
That would. So...
clean the kitchen but not the whole
you just
just clean the sink.
Okay, that sounds good. Which would be by
itself a big improvement.
Yeah. So how likely are you to cling this thing?
you
part of it for sure.
Do you want to maybe set a time limit?
not like clean the sink for
10 minutes and then you can stop.
I'll be good.
That way I could do that.
Is there something else you'd like to do?
this week. Something that
around the apartment that
if you did it, you could say, okay.
This show is I'm starting to take control.
starting to take control of the
apartment.
like doing some of the dishes.
else would make a difference to you.
Oh, that sounds like a big job.
just the sink.
Okay, clean the bathroom sink.
Is this enough for she we give you
one more time.
Alright, so let me go through with this
This is okay, no.
action plan that we have so far in the next
And let's cross some things off or mix them
things easier.
you
All right. So when you do it,
anything that's even a little bit
difficult you're going to give yourself
credit.
And you're going to write it on.
Okay, so paper.
I love her being.
the reminder to do that.
I am going to put down the rubber band.
right.
And we wrote down that the reason to do
This is that I will build your confidence.
you
Yeah. And this is something that you
you're gonna do it night, but you're gonna
and to keep the rubber band and at least try to
keep track of these things during
day also.
Okay, get out of the house 46.
times.
Has that sound? Yep. I can do that.
Okay. How much do you...
agree with this idea. I can do things I
thought I couldn't do.
How to do you think that is?
little things anyway, that's true.
Let's try.
So I'm writing a true next to that.
When I do them, I feel good about them.
Yeah, agree with that.
Maybe this means there are things I can
can do to take control.
time. If I think I'll never get better
