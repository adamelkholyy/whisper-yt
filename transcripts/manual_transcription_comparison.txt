Hey everybody, it's Dr. Joe and today I'm going to talk about Closet.

and they are all verified by a real person. So it's going to be pretty
accurate in English with these subtitles. Did you also know that you can turn the

glitch or maybe if you've watched something in close captioning before
you pull up my video and it already has closed captioning on it. You can easily
turn that off yourself and there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can do
with closed captioning. So I want to talk about three specific things that we'll
help you watch my video a little bit easier for you. So I want to show you how
to turn it on and off which is easy to do. I want to show you how to be able to
to turn it into a different language because YouTube has a whole lot
of different languages you can change it to. Now those languages might not be
100% accurate translations, but it'll be close enough where you'll be able to.
understand what I'm doing. And then you can also change the style of the
itself. You can change the color, you can change the background because sometimes
when it's that dark background. It's kind of hard to see what I'm doing.
You need the clothes captioning. You can make it a little bit easier to see what I'm
doing as well. So I want to make sure and show you here. So let's take a look. So if
If you come here to the screen and look right below just a little bit on the
right bottom side. You see that CC button? That's how you turn closed captioning off.
it off. So if you click that button you can see that the closed captioning pops.
So that's really awesome. It's quick and easy and you can turn it off just as well.
as you can turn it back on. So if they're already on, you can easily turn
them off. Now the way to start changing some things if you go just to the right
of that where the settings little cog wheel is and you click on that if you go
to where it says subtitle slash cc and mine has English next to it you click on
that. Go down below it where it says auto translate. If you click on that you can
see here that there's a whole bunch of different languages you can change it to.
you. So this is just a really great option. You can change it to anything that you
see and as soon as you click on it it will change it to
something different. So that's a really nice option. So if you get it to the
language you want and then you're still having a hard time kind of seeing
through that dark background, pull it back up and then go to the top corner
options right here. Once you click on the options you can see here that it gives
you a whole bunch of different things you can change you can change the bar
color, the size, the background, and the opacity, which is, that's what is the
see through part. So you can do down to 25 where you have a little bit of a
background or you can do zero and so you can see you can see right through the
that wording there. The automatic one is 75% and you can see you can't really see through
that very well. So I'm going to put that at 25% and then if you go back you can
see you can change the colors too. And of course we want green because
green is my favorite color. But again, you can change it to your favorite color.
So this is all really awesome to see here and if you change something in your
I don't like that. I want to go back to the original. You can scroll down
down at the bottom here and reset it. It won't reset the language, but it'll reset the
options and then you go back out and then you can go to auto translate to get
back to the language you want or if you want that English then you can go
back to there. So that gives you a quick rundown of the things that you can do to
make watching my videos easier to follow along because I really do want you.
to feel better soon. So be safe, have fun and of course I hope you feel better soon.
