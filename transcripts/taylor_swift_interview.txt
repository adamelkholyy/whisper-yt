I'm very, very taken by the time for you to leave.
Thank you.
That was nice. I was great to be here.
This is amazing. Now we were talking about
before you've actually been here before.
Yes, I came here. I think about five years ago.
ago I was 16 and just about to release
my first single Tim McGraw.
We were traveling up the West Coast in a
a rental car in a tourist and I was, I was
doing my homework in the back seat. I was
like homeschooled in 10th grade.
That was when we made this trip to San Jose.
and came to see you guys for the
first time and it's wonderful to be back here.
and have so many of you come out this
time around. It's amazing. We're a very
forward thinking company apparently.
having you here when you're 16.
Thank you for being here first.
all from all of us. This is really an honor.
and a treat. Now you're in the
middle of your tour, for speak now.
I know that you've posted some videos to your
channel sort of all in your tour.
and specifically your trip to Asia.
I want to show a clip from when you're in
Singapore. Now you're in Chinatown.
but the Chinatown of Singapore, is that right?
Yes, we started out the year going on
tour and started off in Asia and then we
We're in Europe for two months.
like three months of major worldwide
touring. So Singapore was the first place
that we went on the tour.
Let's roll that clip.
I love you guys.
Of course, as long as you keep first
batteries and then they're always gonna
be saying hello to you just always just
I'm going to go.
It's a bless forever, I think.
Just waving cats.
What's better than a cat that's just always
I always like, hey, there's nothing better than that.
video. I mean, there's a big
celebrity it's a global thing there's
a cat in the video. That'll do it.
I think that you just said it.
essential ingredient is a cat.
YouTube channel is very popular. I know
you have over half a million subs
that get your vlogs when you
post, which is really cool.
I wanted to ask you off the bat, how
important is your channel and social
as a tool for the community and the community.
for expression but also for connecting with your
audience. I think we've all seen the
effects of social media and how that can
connect people. And for me, I grew up when
And that was just about to set fire to the wall.
world. I was I think in
eighth grade when everybody started
having a profile online and everybody
was all about who's your
friend in who's commenting on who's
page and then it became the YouTube
generation where everybody's looking at
videos everybody's making video blogs.
and make up tutorials or this or this.
that are back to school outfit shopping.
you know, everybody is kind of catching up.
on to communicating by making videos.
learning how to edit them.
I think it's fantastic because it's just
a new skill set for this new generation.
And I would be remiss if we're YouTube
video interview on it and ask if you
had any favorite and I really
which have any favorite YouTube videos
Are there channels that you like to watch? Yes.
I have watched this one like three times
because it makes me so happy and
and it's got these like five or six lines.
and there's the Lion Trainer and
and you're like, oh, the lion cubs are cute.
and they're walking around and then they
They jump up on the lion trainer and they
start hugging him and then no
like making all these little lions sounds.
that you don't know.
I didn't know what the sounds are.
line comes make but it's amazing.
It's like, they're like hugging him.
and he's like, oh, you always go for my
hair. You keep going for my hair.
like oh yeah tell me stories
Where was this zoo? It's amazing
It's because he's like Scottish and they're like
hugging him and they love him so much.
much and I don't know.
I guess everybody's gonna run
That's going to be popular now.
This isn't just our interview, right?
your fans interview and you have
some very rabid fans of Swifties, right?
I believe is how they call themselves. I know, I think it's
So cute they came up with that.
very serious by the way. They don't mess with
around. They submitted 30
2000 questions to this interview.
And over so many questions so curious. So we only can
a few of them and we also have some
from Google. But the biggest topic I've
as far as songwriting, because I think that
a lot of your fans have a big connection.
to the stories that you tell on your
songs and so let's start with that top.
and this one comes from Panda Bear Lovers.
13. I mean a lot of the user names are not
meant to be read out loud.
This is from Florida, which comes first
for you as a songwriter, the music or the
I think for me it more comes as
a general idea. And my favorite thing about
about songwriting is that it's so spontaneous.
and unpredictable what's going to hit me
first, whether it's going to be a general
thought. Like for example, you know, I'll
going through something. When I wrote the
This is on Love Story.
sitting on my bedroom floor because
I liked a guy and my parents didn't want to.
me to date him. And so I got this idea in my
my head, it just popped into my head.
Romeo you were throwing pebbles and
Daddy said stay away from Juliet.
And I didn't know where in the song that was going to be.
going to fit but I just started there and I
built out from there. And it's crazy how
the fastest songs that I write end up
being my favorites. The ones that just
happen in just a surge of idea, a surge
of inspiration and it's usually
something I'm going through at the time.
It's very hard for me to come up with
with just some random metaphor for a
situation if I'm not going through it or
haven't recently just gone through it.
but I think when I was
growing up, my mom was, my mom talks in
for a lot. And so I think I grew up
up just understanding metaphor and just
kind of loving that, how you could take
something you're going through and speaking
about it in a different way that applies
how you're feeling to something
completely different but connects it.
So I think for me it starts as an idea.
feeling and an emotion. Yeah. We had a
a lot of questions about the process.
from budding songwriters who submit a
questions that are big fans of fans
years from Buffalo and a bunch of
different places.
wondering is there one favorite
part of the songwriting process that you
I mean, is it when you get that
idea or when you're sitting on the floor
in the bedroom or you know when you're in the studio.
There are several moments in a
song and I won't finish a song if I
don't have these moments where you go, ooh.
like after you read a line.
always that same feeling of like oh
That's exactly what I meant.
you know if you're in a co-writing
session. I'm always the one who will like.
be like sitting there for a second and
And then I'll say a line and if it's
moment where you're just like that that's the
That's the line. I have to have a
four or five of those lines in a song
for me to put it on a record.
lines where I'm just like, yes. So that's
That's my favorite part is then when the song
goes into its phase of being recorded.
and then being put on an album and when you're
you're playing it for people for the
first time when it comes across those
lines that you really feel are like
I don't know, is this Zingers or like, say
really well. I love watching
people's reactions if they, if they, if it
comes across like if they get those
lines. I'm like, yes, do it. We'll get
back to the core anything in a second.
because there are some questions about
that as well.
This is from Music Maniac in Los Angeles.
You've said you're already writing for the
next record. Can you tell us anything?
about it.
Well, yeah, for me, I never
really switch the writing switch off.
It's always on because I kind of have
was felt like to make an album that I
and proud enough of to give to my fans.
and say here, you know, allow the
into your life. It has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has to be like, it has
be two to two and a half years
writing and that way you know you have
your best stuff because I'm so tough on my
myself. I drive myself insane writing.
records and albums because it's like
I'll write like 40 to 50 songs and then
13 or 14 make it that's a lot of pairing
down and making sure you're
getting to the best stuff. So for me, it's
takes a while and I've been writing every
since I stopped writing the last album.
And there's been a lot that's happened.
and I never really talk about my business.
personal life, but I write about it.
So that's basically what the album is about.
out as always.
something that came up a lot in one of the
The top voter questions was about, you know,
would you ever make a CD of your
up unreleased songs is from Taste Swift Fearless.
in Missouri. But I mean, what happens to the
those songs that don't make it to the album.
And would you ever release some of
songs you wrote especially when you're
younger like 14-15. Well I'm very
I'm obsessed with the latest song that I've ever played.
written. I'm very guilty of that.
because my favorite thing is always
the newest thing that I've written but
But lately I've become a little more
self-aware because I had this song that I
I wrote when I was 16 and it's called
spark slide and I played it in a few
shows, these little bar shows when
you know, when I was playing tick crowds of
like 40 and 50 people and being psyched.
about that many people showing up.
I played it a few times and it got on the
internet and when I was putting together
the
saying over and over again.
want this to be on the record.
went back and I revisited it and I kind of
rewrote some things and updated it.
and when we put it out as a single it's
it's been one of the fastest
songs we've had on the record. So it's
kind of taught me a lesson about the old
stuff maybe
possibly being good enough to put on
new projects. Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of
people that would love to hear some
that stuff. What's move on to some of
the release songs.
from cookie 13 cupcake.
United Kingdom. This is going to be a long
one of the
Alright so out of all your releases
songs which song took the longest
I think that the song sparks flash.
the fact that it technically was started
when I was 16 and ended up on an album.
in sort of a different form in 2010.
took a while for it to turn into what it was
was going to be. So I'd say that was
probably the longest developing song
that I've ever put out because most of the
and especially having written this
entire new record without any co-writers.
It all happened really fast because I'm very
impatient. Like if I don't have a song
finished I'll obsess over it I won't
sleep that night and I'll just edit
it constantly to the point where I can't
focus on a conversation and everyone around
me is annoyed because they're like
clearly you're working on something just
finish it. So that one was a long
time to kind of get where it needed to be.
So let's talk about that.
co-writer thing for second you as you
mentioned this album was all you as far as
at first speak now. But you do
often work with co-writers and had
you decide if you're going to write a
song with a co-writer whether you're gonna
tackle it yourself.
a bunch of different circumstances that
could bring about a co-write.
writing for somebody else's project.
that's always exciting for me.
love to put myself in somebody else's
issues and you know think about their
style of music incorporating their
storyline what they're feeling.
really fun for me to do that. So I love
of writing for other people.
Then, you know, if I'm working on an idea
but there's like a stopping point where I
I can't really figure out where
this course is going or if I'm right if
my hunch is right about the hook or
things like that.
if there's a definite stopping point.
I'll bring it to a writer that I trust.
or writer that I admire and just I
them what they think. A lot of times
co-writing, you know, I write really well.
well with people who don't even play
instruments we're seeing because you know
a lot of times my best co-readers are.
just really great at giving advice. Like, do you
Do you think this course is too long? Yes.
Like, thank you. Yeah.
you're working with right now that you guys
talk about? Yes. You know for me
since I write so much and I don't know why.
what's gonna end up on the record.
I never want to say, well, do you know what I mean?
wrote with this person and because
then what if it doesn't make it on the
record. And then writing for some
other people's projects in which case I
I feel weird talking about it because
It's like their projects. So yes, but.
Yeah. This was a popular, a lot of votes
this question. This is from quadratic
formula in Michigan. It's appropriate for
Google. Do you sing your own songs in the
shower. Yeah. Awesome. That's great.
Do you have any sort of favorite
for writing songs? No, actually.
I kind of have become, you have to adapt
yourself to a million different
places to write when you're always on the road.
because I just I don't have the luck
of saying, well, I have to be in this
certain room at this certain part of
town and it has to be all one
color tone and there has to be smart
water in there. You know, like it's
you're never ever anywhere from more than
two and a half seconds.
written songs in airport bathrooms on
paper towels. I've written songs.
What song was on a bathroom towel?
at one point. It hasn't come out.
Oh, you know, in the bus bunk, you'll wake up.
up in the middle of the night and you're
have this idea and then so you write it.
and you're up at 4 a.m. or you know
I get awakened by song ideas all the time.
time. And it's just, it's like I wake up and
I'm just like, oh great. Because I know I'm
I won't forget I won't remember it in the
morning so you have to record it.
And then it's this whole thing where you just
check your phone and it's like mumbling
and you don't understand. You thought it was
was great at the time. Yeah, actually one of
of our Google Earth questions was about
you recording songs into your cell phone.
Is that something that you do regularly?
Yeah, the ideas always end up in my phone.
because it has a great recording thing.
in there and you know for me it's like
You just write wherever whenever you can.
And that's been really fun for me.
because sometimes I'll walk into a hotel.
tell her I'm gonna be like, I've been here.
I wrote back to December here.
it's fun because you have these memories
of writing songs all over the world.
Cool. So I know a lot of your songs are very
personal songs and a lot of your
fans are very interested in that stuff.
but this one came from Michaela Kay.
South Florida has any guy asked you not
to write a song about him before you
on a date.
Because at that point they're thinking
that I would never have any
reasons to write a bad song about them.
And then it's when, you know, when they
start to treat me in a way
that wouldn't reflect well on them in a song.
if I were to be honest about it.
like I be like, you're not gonna write it but
about this, are you?
I'm like, yeah, I am.
That's a point in a relationship.
that you would have to have is this is the
where I tell her not to write a
about me.
that they would decide that before
before asking me on the date or before we
become a couple or before all this stuff
happens, but it only occurs to, it only occurs
Well, him, it only occurred to him when...
when he it occurred to him that it
It wouldn't be a good song.
people that you know? Yeah, because I feel
like in a song, I love it when a song is a
story and the story develops and my
favorite stories have really beautiful
beautiful characters and I feel like you can most
accurately describe a character if you
know them. One of my favorite songs that
I've ever put out is called 15.
about my freshman year of high school.
and it kind of chronicles my best friend out there.
Abigail and me and the way that we
went through our freshman year of high
school and the lessons we learned.
That's kind of how I like to tell a
stories from the point of view of
really knowing what you're talking about.
and knowing where you're coming from.
because you were there.
actually go to another video.
first video question. And this one comes from
from Cleveland, Ohio. So let's roll it.
I know a lot of us can relate really
strongly to your songs and your lyrics.
and considering I've gotten choke choke for
couple of times just listening to your
sounds. I wonder if you ever get choked up
on stage or what you're thinking
about when you're on stage.
I'm really in it when I'm on TV.
stage and you know I go through a
roller coaster of emotions when I'm
performing my show because these are all
songs about people who have been in my
life, a lot of them, some of them
aren't in my life anymore.
sometimes that'll hit you and just throw
right way and when an emotion hits
you strongly. It doesn't matter if you're
in front of 20,000 people, it hits you.
And you know, for me, I'm in those
songs, fully feeling all of it, until
hear the crowd start screaming at the end.
the song.
just like, can't stop smiling because my
favorite sound in the world is the sound
of thousands of people screaming all at once.
It's a really amazing sound.
And so I'm completely feeling all the
sadness and frustration and anger and
hurt and then the crowds start screaming
and then everything is right in the world.
world.
Well, we'll talk about the tour and
and some of that stuff in a second.
one more Googler question about
songwriting and that was Has That
process that you sort of talked about.
earlier has that changed over the years.
because you know you've grown up a lot.
Everybody's heard you sort of grow.
Yeah, I think it really has.
that you can only hope that as a writer
you start trying different things.
and you try different chords or different
structures of songs, different beats that you
you've never really explored that path.
before. And I think having
always been a writer first. I'm obsessed.
with the syncopation of the way that we
words sound when they're said a certain
way and once I've kind of done something
once I always want to go to a different
direction and never repeat myself.
As a writer, I think that I've always hoped
that my music would constantly be
changing because you never want to make
the same album twice, the same song twice.
and you know my greatest hope has been
that as I grow
My fans will grow up with me and as I
change and my life changes my musical
change as well. So wish me luck there.
Let's talk about your fans a little bit more.
This is a question from Canada.
YouTube. What was the funniest thing I've
fan has ever done to get your attention.
Well, there's a lot of that lately.
because we have this thing called the
party room. And, you know, I have like
before five meet and greets before the show.
show. But after the show, there's
a meet and greet for surprise people who
did not know that they were going to get
meet in great because they were picked.
for the Tea Party Room, which means that
they were like going crazy dancing the whole
whole time, dressing some absurd cravings.
I'm Daisy Costume from one of my music videos.
or just knew every single word and we're just
screaming the whole time.
people get picked for different reasons.
but it's been crazy lately because
a lot of people have been going for the
costume route. Really? So we'll look out
and like my guitar player will like lean
over to me and be like, that girl is dressed.
like a chicken and I and like
I'm trying to find the meaning. I don't know.
why but you know we'll look out in there
There's like a Santa Claus.
these are just like
entire body and neon duct tape. Or people
who have just made giant cupcakes.
around themselves and they're like
They're this big or people who have like
dressed up from the mean video or
something like that.
just these ones where like the girls
dressed as like, there's like a clown and a
starfish and we're like I don't know
why but I love it. And so there's
There's been a lot of costume stuff
going on lately on the tour. So if you
look around and you see someone dressed
up as a giant cow and you don't know why.
We don't know why either.
welcome. Now this is a I love Swift one.
from Toronto.
another Canada question. Has a fan ever
made you cry. Yeah.
you know for me like it's never going to be
be okay, no matter how many times I see.
little kids with cancer. Like there's
There's at no point do you ever become.
a custom to it.
just brush it off and say oh well
There's another kid who's dying.
know, and I, over the years I've toured in
places and you see like a little
who come through and she's like so
full of life but she's lost her hair.
And then you come through a year later and
And you're like, hey, Lexi, how are you doing?
she's like I'm doing good and then
your parents update you and
And then you come by like a year and a half.
later and she's not there. So it's...
Yeah. Yeah. You have all these fans.
all over the world of all different ages and
and types.
Did you think there would be any other
career path so you were going to take.
that you might not have ended up in this way.
Yeah, I mean ever since I was a little
okay, ever since I was like eight years
My dad has been telling me to save my life.
my money or investing utilities. What?
And because my dad is a stock broker and he
lives and breathes it. I mean, he's like
like my dad is so passionate about what he
does in the way that I'm passionate.
about music, this guy lives for being a
stockbroker. That is his thing. Like
and anybody who talks to him like, he'll talk to me.
about me for the first five minutes and
And it's like, we'll say what are you doing?
investing in.
just like he loves it. And so I thought
I didn't know what a stalker was.
broke or was when I was eight but I would just
just tell everybody that's what I was going to do.
be like you know it would be it like
you know, first day of school and then
like so what do you guys want to be when you
grow up and everybody's like
be an astronaut or like I want to be a
I'm gonna be a
financial advisor.
much because he's so gung ho for his job.
And I just saw how happy it made him and I
I just thought like I can broke stocks.
Like Taylor Swift, a lot of you straighter.
Let's talk about music videos for a
second. There's a lot of questions
your music videos as I mentioned
for the music videos that you have on your
YouTube have been seen over half a
billion times. What was your
favorite music video to make and watch.
that's from Sophie Kerry in London.
favorite music video to make. Okay.
Well, I loved making the video fun.
from mine because it dealt with the
whole storyline and it's like up
flashbacks and flash forwards. And there
We're also a bunch of little kids on this
and they're so fun. They make it so
much fun because there's a lot of
sitting around and waiting on sets and
We were in Maine, so we're sitting around.
and waiting on a beach.
and you're just playing with like 10
kids and they're like wrestling with the
each other and throwing sand and like
playing catch and it just makes the
whole thing much more fun. So I think
I think that was my favorite one to make.
Were there any cool locations or any
anything from any of those videos?
Yeah, we went to Kenny Bungport, Maine.
which was this little town that I've
dream to going to and so
shooting a video there was amazing.
little coastal town.
It was really awesome. I loved it.
So let's talk about the tour for a second.
You're in the middle of the speak now, Tor.
and very famously you've had some really
the cool surprise duets that you've done.
And you also do some very classic.
covers of some classic songs.
the time pretty much every night. How do you
choose what covers you'll end up doing.
in any particular concert?
online and I just kind of Google like
what people, what famous musicians are
from a certain area. And I just picked my
favorites because you know I've I've
I've loved so many different kinds of music.
I've never really been genres
specific as far as what I listen to.
there's always like a favorite song
of mine for
from a certain area.
It's really fun to do like a few every night.
like, you know, in California, I do like
God only knows by the beach boys and
and then sweet escape by Gwen Stefani.
It's just been really, really fun.
because it's just me and my
tar during the acoustic set and you can just
do whatever, because it's just you and your
instrument. It's really
Yeah, have you done any
particularly unusual ones.
It's kind of unusual.
when I rap. You know, people don't really
I guess people don't see that
coming, but I love to lose yourself.
We were in an area where we were like I
I think we were in Michigan and I just
started like I started playing
acoustically lose yourself and I just
started off with like yo and everybody's
just like what is happening.
It's really weird, but I just I love
great song. I don't care what genre it's
and I don't care if it's completely
opposite from what people think is you know
country music and I just I love it
great song. Yeah. One of the Googlers
questions that we got was about which
song of yours is the most fun for you to play.
I really like better than
of
I'm speaking now and it's about a girl who's
I'm gonna restore my boyfriend and I got mad.
wrote a song about it.
And we do this like just it's just
And I'm just curious and angry and fun and like we have a lot of fun.
have this gigantic bridge that drops
down from the ceiling and me and my
to backup singers are on the bridge.
just like throwing our hair around in
head banging. And so that's a really fun
want to do. And for me, they're all, they're
I think dear John has a fun
pay off. If you go see the show, I
I really love singing that because in the end
and it's got this, you know, pyro filled.
pay off in the end.
Would you say those are two of the songs that
the crowd going the most or there are
other ones.
come to a show because the crowds are
really kind of steadily, ear piercingly
throughout the whole show.
They're amazing like it's really hard to
like which is the moment that that
They're the loudest because they're just
really really loud all the time.
of a funny question. This is from Ali Law in
and Dunlap Tennessee.
a person that would name their guitar.
Do you name your guitars and what are the
their names.
I do seem like that kind of person, but I
I haven't done it yet. I kind of think that
back on the situations when I got them.
when I fell in love with that
particular guitar. Like there's one of my
guitars, it's an acoustic and it's blue.
and it's got koi fish swimming up the
and like in-lays it's just beautiful
and it was Bob Taylor sent it to me for me.
18th birthday.
Oh well. So I remember the first time
I opened up this guitar case and I'm just
There's like, there's fish on the guitar.
This gorgeous guitar and so that's what I
remember about that and then there's
This is sparkly guitar that I play that has
hundreds of tiny little crystals on it.
and it looks like we had us
especially made, but really we just glued them on.
Oh really?
Yeah, and sometimes little ones fall
they fall off and so we'll have to
to superglue moron with tweezers.
So that's always what cracks me up about.
that because it's like everyone's like
Where did you have your guitar especially?
made. I'm like super glue. Like how
How many guitars you use in a show?
those do you go through? Okay well um
That was a weird sound. I just made that was
weird sorry.
The first one is electric, the cigarette one.
is acoustic coa, then there's the 12
string and there's the blue, koi fish.
one and then there's, oh four.
Yeah, wow. And then there's a ukulele and a
Ganjo.
Obviously you're on
toward a lot and you, that's where you see
spend a lot of your time but there were a lot of
a lot of questions about what you do.
you're not performing and you're
between Giggs, which decides to write in songs.
like you do. And so, you know, I guess first
question are there any movies that you'll
like to watch while you're on tour.
I watch a lot of TV, like a lot of TV.
And my favorites are like the crime show.
where it starts out and you know you
You can't miss the first scene or else you
like the discovery of this crime
seen and then you know the like
twists and turns of it all.
I love CSI Law and Order SBU without
trace.
and CIS lock up raw. Like, uh, wow.
really afraid of getting in trouble.
I have no idea.
Alright, that's who watched his lock up.
Taylor Swift actually. Yeah.
awesome
No, but also one of the questions I
We got was about what books the
read in your free time.
Oh, mostly history. I'm obsessed with
with other time periods.
I'm always looking up museums or like the
historical society or like historical
landmarks that we can go to in a
particular city where we are.
And recently I've been reading a lot of
books on like John Adams and Abraham
Lincoln and I read this like 750 pages
book called The Kennedy Women.
dates back to the lineage of our
the first Kennedy woman who came across
from Ireland on the boat and like the
1860s and it's just this crazy
interesting read. So that's what I've been
reading lately. I'm sort of
with history. Yeah. Well, let's talk about books.
for a second. One of the questions that
got actually from one of the future
Googlers in the audience was that
about how you wrote a novel when you're
11 years old. I was 14.
No, wait. You were younger?
13 I think yeah, but I did
I was, I have a lot of different
piffenies. I always have different eyes.
ideas as to like, ooh, you know, this would
be a good idea. And one summer I was, I was
at the shore. We suspend our
summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey.
all my friends were back in Pennsylvania.
and so I had nothing to do and so I had
the Sepiphany, I'm going to be a novelist.
And I'm going to write novels and that's
going to be my career path. And so I would

book and send them back to my friends.

under different names, but totally
describe their personalities and it was
really fun way to spend the summer.
My parents were so frustrated because I
I would never go outside. I'd just be like
locked in this little study with my
computer. But I've always been a writer.
first. It's my favorite thing is how
you can convey a thought or a story or
completely describe a character.
or a situation through words.
right combination of words and the whole
process of editing and re-editing and
rethinking and imagining and you get
these little mini just epiphany ideas.
that come to you. And I think that that
That's what I loved about writing the novel.
That's what I love about poetry and it's
what I love about songwriting.
And while we're on the topic of things, you do
while you're on tour and stuff like that.
We had a lot of questions about what it is
that you like to do when you're on
and you're not performing as a
other things that you like to spend your
time doing. What I love to do.
You know, I watch a lot of TV.

Yeah, crime shows. That's pretty much the
the hobby list.
Googler here. And this is, it says, as
father of a teenage daughter, it's great
to see that solid songwriting and
hard work and get recognized. Do you have
any advice for young aspiring musicians.
Absolutely. I think that you have to love
it more than anything else.
love it for so many more reasons.
other than your idea of what the end
result could be. Like you don't make an
album so that you can get a platinum
record to hang on your wall. Right.
and you don't go on tour so that you can
hang the sold out plaques up in
you know, your bedroom. It's like, it's so many
little stepping stones and so many
people have this idea that it's like you
get discovered and then you get the
record deal and then you record the song.
and then this song goes number one.
And it's like it's never
like that. Like it very rarely is it like
one thing leads to another which
to another and result. It's so many
dead ends and switching directions and
and going back and replanting and rethinking.
and so many interviews and strategy
and management meetings and PR
meetings and so many things that are so
outside of music that you have to love
music so much that just your hour and a half
have to two hours on stage every now.

going to go through. And also I would say
play your own instrument because it's
easier than dragging around like a
karaoke machine.
starting out you have to provide
background music and it's just

Cool. All right, so we're gonna we have one

questions we've been talking about.
Let's roll that. Hey, Taylor, it's Nick.
I have a question for you
What does being beautiful mean to you?
I mean the fine your definition of use
What beauty means in your eyes and why?
I love him. I think for me beauty is
sincerity. I think that there are so many
different ways that someone can be
beautiful. You know, someone so funny.
that it makes them beautiful.
matter how they look because they're
sincere in it or somebody's like really
emotional and like moody and thoughtful
and
because that's sincerely who they are.
or you look out into the crowd and you see
someone so happy that they're smiling
from ear to ear and that sincerity comes
through. I think that's what makes
somebody beautiful and I've never felt
like there's just one way to be
beautiful, tall or short.
straight hair or curly or whatever
some people have their definitions of
their types. You know, for me, I think that
when I meet someone and there's that
magical thing about them that makes them
unforgettable is that they're sincere
and honest in whoever they are, be that
funny, happy, sad, you know, going through a
rough times sarcastic. I think that these
personality traits that come through
when somebody is really sincere is what
makes them beautiful. Cool. I think that's
a great note to Emerson.
